  <h1>Welcome to my 2024 Year in Review!</h1>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="../2023/">Aaron's 2023 Year in Review</a>
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h1>Year of the Marathon!</h1>
  <p>
    My big goal for 2024 was to run a marathon.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's right, a full-on marathon: 26.2 miles...as fast as you can.
  </p>
  <h2>San Francisco Marathon</h2>
  <p>
    Considered one of the most beautiful and challenging marathon
    courses.  Beautiful because you run along the Embarcadero
    waterfront, up and over the Golden Gate Bridge (twice!), then
    through Golden Gate Park and back to the Bay to finish in front of
    the historic Ferry Building.  But also challenging due to the 700
    feet of uphill that you run along the course, not to mention the
    corresponding 700 feet back down.  But, I have to say, the beauty
    of the course wins out.  I kept thinking to myself,
    "I <em>get</em> to do this!"  Yes, it's a challenge, but a
    challenge I am so privileged to be able to take on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started training in March for the race at the end of July.  It
    was an 18-week training program from Hal Higdon.  I won't dive
    into the details here, but if you are interested in the training
    progression: <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/">Marathon
    Training: Novice 1</a>.
  </p>
  <div><img src="SF-marathon-morning.jpg" width="100%" title="Excited to start my first marathon!" /></div>
  <p>
    On race day, I was super pumped, very well trained and prepared.
    I felt strong through the first half, and thought that if I could
    buckle-down and make it to mile 20, then all the uphills would be
    done and I could fly down from Haight-Ashbury to the Mission and
    then blast through the last few flat miles to the finish line.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, just like everyone says, between mile 20 and 22 I hit "the
    wall".  It was actually kinda amazing to experience the body
    breaking down, literally feeling the nerve impulses not move down
    and through the legs as efficiently as before.  It was kinda like
    driving a car that was leaking oil: you could feel the engine
    struggling and starting to sputter as the essential ingredients to
    keep it running were depleted.  By the time I hit the final couple
    miles, I could feel my right hamstring on the verge of cramping,
    ending the race on the spot.  There were so many other runners
    pulling up with similar cramping problems; the sidewalks were
    littered with bodies.  I had to mix walking with running to keep
    it from freezing-up entirely., but I rallied and ran through the
    finish line with an official time: 3:49:47!
  </p>
  <div><img src="SF-marathon.jpg" width="100%" title="San Francsico Marathon" /></div>
  <p>
    I did it!!  I completed my first marathon!  And under 4 hours!
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

  <h2>California International Marathon</h2>
  <img src="run-another-one.jpg" class="center" />
  <p>
    About a week after finishing the SF Marathon, I thought....I could
    do better.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I signed up for the California International Marathon (CIM) in
    December.  CIM is actually hosted in Sacramento, with the course
    starting out near Folsom Lake and finishing on the steps of the
    state capitol building.  TBH, not as inspiriing a course as San
    Francisco, but CIM is a "downhill" course and where many people
    achieve their fastest marathon times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing how the wheels came off the wagon around mile 22 in the SF
    Marathon, I was eager try again and see if I could improve on that
    final stage.  So, I decided to raise my training
    regimen <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/">one
    level up</a> and see what I could do.  This more aggressive
    training program felt doable, but was no joke: it was nearly 100
    miles more than what I did for the SF Marathon, and I was going to
    run it more aggressively to see what my limits were.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, you don't discover your limits during training, but on race
    day
  </p>
  <p>
    That's my main take-away from CIM, my second marathon.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CIM training program went well, showing improvement from the
    SF Marathon training program at every step of the way.  And come
    race day, I was ready with corrections to some minor mistakes I
    had made in fueling and hydration the first time around; nothing
    major, just some tweaks.  I was also cognizant that CIM is a fast,
    downhill course at the start, so I went out purposefully a bit
    slower than my first time out.  This strategy initially paid off
    well, as I hit the halfway mark feeling a lot stronger than in my
    first marathon.  I felt well-positioned to keep my pace up,
    perhaps even running faster in the second half.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, I hit that same mile 22 -- and just like in the first
    marathon -- the wheels fell off the applecart.  I started getting
    some serious cramping in my calves, especially the left one.  For
    about the next 2 miles I had to alternate between running and
    walking, even stopping here and there to stretch out the calves.
    I am proud of myself that I grit my teeth and ran the final 2.2
    miles, pushing strong across the finish line.

  <h1>Year of the Ultra-Marathon!</h1>
  <p>
    But wait, there's more!
  </p>
  <p>
    Yep, in addition to running 2 regular-degular marathons this year,
    I also ran 2 ultra-marathons
  </p>
  <p>
    What's an ultra-marathon, you ask?  Well, it's just any race
     longer than a marathon.  Also, <em>ultras</em> (as they are known)
    are typically run on trails, or some combination or trails and
    road.  You can think of a regular "road marathon" as the kind of
    race that is through downtown city streets, whereas an
    ultra-marathon is out in the woods or countryside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, classic marathons are a fixed distance of 26.2 miles, but
    ultras can be either a fixed distance (usually 31 miles or more)
    or some other format that results in runners running more than a
    marathon in total.  More on that to below!
  </p>
  
  <h2>Icy-8</h2>
  <p>
    The Icy-8 is not a race of distance, but rather of time: you have
    8 hours to run as far as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The course is setup as loops: 8 miles, 4 miles, 2 miles.  You can
    run as many loops as you can/want within 8 hours, and at the end
    they total up your distance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, and I forgot to say, this is out in the Virginia countryside!
    So, I flew out to DC to hang out with Chris and Jon as we made our
    way around the course.  Mind you, this was back in February, in
    the middle of the Virginia winter, but we lucked out with an
    entirely pleasant day with pretty much ideal conditions for a
    mid-winter ultra.
  </p>
  <div><img src="Icy8.jpg" width="100%" title="Me, CJ, and Jon at the Icy-8 Ultra Trail Race" /></div>
  <p>
    I did four 8-mile loops, for a total of 32 miles, in 7 hours and
    45 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I gotta say that some highlights of that weekend were the
    post-race burgers and beers followed by a rejuvinating dip in the
    hot tub!
  </p>

  <h2><a href="https://brylers.com/">Brylers Backyard Marathon</a></h2>
  <p>
    But why run one ultra when you can run two at twice the price?
  </p>
  <p>
    Late summer I walk talking with Tyler, a co-worker at Databricks,
    about our respective running journeys and he mentioned that he and
    his friend Bryce were organizing a backyard marathon in their
    hometown of Austin, TX.  A backyard marathon, you say?  I'm in!
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the Icy-8, the backyard marathon format is not one of
    distance, and unlike the Icy-8, it is not a bound by time --
    rather, it's
    a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRXKZSqvtrw&pp=ygURYmFja3lhcmQgbWFyYXRob24%3D">"last
    one standing race"</a>.  You map out a loop, in our case, a 2.5
    mile trail loop that starts and ends at Tyler's house; then you
    run that loop at the top of the hour, then the top of the next
    hour, and so on and so on until no one can run any more loops.  We
    started at 7am and ran 15 loops in 15 hours, calling it quits at
    10pm.
  </p>
  <div><img src="Brylers-Backyard-Marathon.jpg" width="100%" title="Brylers Backyard Marahton runners" /></div>
   <p>
    What I liked about this format is that you stay together.  Unlike
    other utra races, where you tend to spread out over the course,
    this is a fairly short loop, and everyone is back to Tyler's house
    after 30-35 mins of running, and then you have 25-30 mins to
    snack, rehydrate, stretch and rest, then at the top of the next
    hour, everyone starts the next loop together.  Well, at least
    everyone who can muster up another loop!
  </p>
  <div><img src="Tyler-Bryce-me.jpg" width="100%" title="Tyler, Bryce, and me after 15 loops in 15 hours" /></div>
  <p>
    We had about 30 people participate throughout the day.  Some came
    in the morning to run a few loops; others stopped by in the
    afternoon, and a few left and then came back in the evening to
    give us an energy boost.  Tyler, Bryce, and I did the full 15
    loops over the course of 15 hours.  Our efforts were rewarded with
    pizza delivery and some ice cold beers just before midnight.
  </p>
    
  <h1>Winter Sports</h1>
  <p>
    But 2024 was not all about just running...how about some skiing
    too!
  </p>
  <p>
    The main part of this story was an extended ski holiday in Vail,
    Colorado.  This was actually my very first time skiing (or
    snowboarding for that matter) in the Rocky Mountains.  Oh, and
    that's right, I said skiing, not snowboarding.  After last year's
    trip to Whistler Blackcomb, my snowboard gear was 20 years old and
    end-of-life.  I decided to go back to skiing, just for variety's
    sake.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best part about the Vail trip wasn't the condo with a hot tub,
    nor the massive, massive terrain at Vail, but the fact that I got
    to share the experience with three of my best friends.  Scott
    drove out from Denver/Boulder for a few days and we skiied both
    Vail and Beaver Creek.
  </p>
  <div><img src="Vail-with-Scott.jpg" width="100%" title="Me and Scott at Vail" /></div>
  <p>
    After Scott, Rob flew out from SF and we
    got a solid week in at Vail, running what felt like a thousand
    laps in the legendary Back Bowls.
  </p>
  <div><img src="Vail-with-Rob.jpg" width="100%" title="Me and Rob at Vail" /></div>
  <p>
    Then, Rob took off and Mark flew out from Cleveland for few days
    of cruising and being terrorized by 5-7 year olds flying by us
    geezers.
  </p>
  <div><img src="Vail-with-Mark.jpg" width="100%" title="Me and Mark at Vail" /></div>
  <p>
    After returning from Vail, Rob and I did some weekend trips up to
    Tahoe for the remainder of the season.  All told:
    <ul>
      <li>27 days on the slopes</li>
      <li>5 resorts: Vail, Beaver Creek, Palisades, Alpine, Homewood</li>
      <li>402 runs</li>
      <li>447,512 vertical feet</li>
      <li>714.12 total miles</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <div><img src="Homewood.jpg" width="100%" title="Homewood view of Lake Tahoe" /></div>

  <h1>Health, Fitness, and Wardrobe</h1>
  <p>
    As you can imagine, with all the skiing, running and weight
    training I did throughout the year, I kept quite well to my
    fitness goals.  As far as weight goes, I entered the year at 187
    pounds, and by the end of June I had reduced down as low as 165.
    That wasn't my target really, I just wanted to see how low I could
    go by the mid-year mark.  My target maintenance range is somewhere
    between 170 and 175, which I've been able to maintain for the
    second half of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also was curious about body composition (essentially your body
    fat %), so I signed up
    with <a href="https://www.bodyspec.com/">BodySpec</a> for regular
    Dexa scans throughout the year.  I set a goal of being below 20%
    body fat by mid-year and crushed it with a measurement of 17% at
    165 pounds (75 kg).
  </p>
  <p>
    The one aspect of slimmng down that I didn't fully appreciate was
    that I'd have to buy all new clothes!  Sure, it makes logical
    sense, but after getting through ski season wearing mostly
    athletic gear and leisure-wear, I decided that I needed some new
    clothes for summer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start adjusting to this "new normal" of body shape, I thought
    I'd start off simple and cheap by hitting the major fast-fashion
    retailers: Zara, H&amp;M, Gap, etc.  What really took me by
    surprise was the sizing.  Sure, I had grabbed some t-shirts during
    ski season, which were size Medium, but for some of the stuff I
    was buying for summer -- casual summer shirts and shorts -- I was
    buying size Small.  Outrageous!
  </p>
  <p>
    While I'm sure there as been "grade deflation" in sizes over the
    years, I haven't been this size since my college days.
  </p>

  <h1>Family</h1>
  <p>
    Good fortune shined upon me with a work trip up to Seattle in
    early October.  This afforded me a chance to have dinner with
    Diana, Steve, Rebecca, and Philip.  So good to see and hear that
    everyone is doing well!
  </p>
  <div><img src="Rennicks.jpg" width="100%" title="Steve, Philip, Rebecca, me, Diana" /></div>
  
  <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
  <p>
    2024 was such an amazing year, packed with so many fantastic and
    rewarding experiences, only a sliver of which I could share with
    you in this letter.  Therefore, I am looking forward to 2025 with
    excitement and eagerness of all the amazing experiences yet to
    come.  I kick off the new year in proper fashion with a 2-week ski
    trip to Japan: one week in Hakuba Valley and one week in Niseko.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to see you in the new year!
