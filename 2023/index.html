  <h1>Welcome to my 2023 Year in Review!</h1>
  <p>
    If you haven't read last year's, you might want to check it out
    first, as many of the same themes that marked my 2022 continue on
    in 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="../2022/">Aaron's 2022 Year in Review</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    And speaking of contining themes, let's kick this one off with my
    big fitness achievement of this year...
  </p>
  <h1>Golden Gate Trail Classic 50K</h1>
  <p>
    It all started with a text...
  </p>
  <div class="chat">
    <div data-time="Wednesday, Feb 8, 2023 | 07:08 | Chris Johnson" class="msg rcvd">
      There's a 50k trail race in San Fran and the marin headlands on <u>Nov 18</u>, fyi.
      There's also 10k and half marathon options.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    See, back in December 2022, as I was just starting to get into
    running, I started a DM group with college best friends who have
    all been runners for many years.  It was equal amounts of
    discussion on running, races, and general shit-talking.  And on
    February 8, 2023, Chris set it all in motion with that one text.
  </p>
  <div><img src="GoldenGateTrailClassic-course.png" width="100%" title="Golden Gate Trail Classic 50K Course" /></div>
  <p>
    At this point, I had just started running regularly, with just a
    few 5K races under my belt, so a 50K trail race felt
    a <em>looooooong</em> ways off.  But, I was interested, so I
    signed up for the 10K distance.  Over the course of the ensuing
    months, as I ran more, gradually extended the distances of my
    races, and with the encouragement and support of my friends, I
    finally felt up to the challenge of the 50K distance and upgraded
    my registration to the full 50K.
  </p>
  <div><img src="GoldenGateTrailClassic-ferry.jpg" width="100%" title="Taking the ferry to Sausalito" /></div>
  <p>
    When the race finally came, it was a weekend full of friendship
    and fun, for not only did the runners all fly out to San Francisco
    to run with me, but their wives also came along to make a big trip
    out of it.  Jon & Ellen, Zuf & Jennie, and Chris & Kristen all
    flew out for the long weekend.  We took the ferry over to
    Sausalito fo lunch, carbo loaded with Chicago-style pizza, and
    enjoyed a sunny brunch out on the deck at Mission Rock Resort.
  </p>
  <div><img src="GoldenGateTrailClassic-runners.jpg" width="100%" title="Trail Delts ready to run!" /></div>
  <p>
    The race itself was an incredible experience: 50 kilometers, or 31
    miles, starting at Land's End in San Francsico, across the Golden
    Gate Bridge, and then a big loop around the Marin Headlands.  All
    told, nearly 6,000 feet of climb and 6,000 feet of descent over
    the course of the 50K.  The weather was very misty and cloudy with
    some light rain, but at least it kept us cool.  The four of us
    &mdash; Zuf, Chris, Jon, and me &mdash; stayed together for about 75% of
    the race, then Zuf and I went ahead just before finishing the loop
    and returning across the Golden Gate Bridge.
  </p>
  <div><img src="GoldenGateTrailClassic-runners-on-course.jpg" width="100%" title="Over halfway done!" /></div>
  <p>
    When we arrived back to the start/finish line, I was so pumped,
    that I ran at full sprint with everything I had left for the last
    50 yards and lept in the air across the finish line!
  </p>
  <p>
    I almost couldn't believe it: going from my first 5K in 32-some
    years to completing an ultramarathon, all in under 12 months.  I
    could not have done it without their encouragement and support.
  </p>
  <div><img src="GoldenGateTrailClassic-Aaron.jpg" width="100%" title="Me making the first big climb" /></div>
 
  <h1>Running</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to the Golden Gate Trail Classic 50K, I ran a race of
    some sort or another nearly every month this year.
  </p>
  <div><img src="RaceBibs.jpg" width="100%" title="Race Bibs" /></div>
  <p>
    The other big running achievement came a few weeks after that
    ultramarathon.  That first race I ran as part of this journey, The
    Elf Run 5K (3.1 miles), is an annual affair, so I had my sights
    set on running it again and dramatically improving my time over
    last year.
  </p>
  <div><img src="ElfRunTime.png" width="100%" title="Crushed it with a 22:22" /></div>
  <p>
    Crushed it!
  </p>
  <p>
    Last year I clocked a time of 32 minutes and 56 seconds.  This
    year, my goal was 25 minutes, which is almost exactly an
    8-minute/mile pace.  My secret, deep in my heart-of-hearts stretch
    goal was to knock a solid 10 minutes off my time and get under
    22:56.  Beat 'em both with a time of 22:22!
  </p>
  
  <h1>Travels</h1>
  <p>
    But my year was not defined by running alone, I also enjoyed two
    big trips.
  </p>

  <h2>Whistler Blackcomb</h2>
  <p>
    I was able to check-off a bucket list item with a month of
    snowboarding at Whistler Blackcomb ski resort.
  </p>
  <div><img src="WhistlerBlackcomb-3.jpg" width="100%" title="Blame Canada!" /></div>
  <p>
    Growing up in the Seattle area and starting to ski as a teenager,
    Whistler Blackcomb always loomed large in the collective ski
    consciousness, being the largest ski resort in the northwest, and
    fabled for it's long top-to-bottom runs.  So, in late 2022, when
    the right opportunity arose, I booked a ski-in/ski-out condo for
    the entire month of January.  I could walk out of the condo, cross
    the street, and then just steps to the gondola.  A snowboarder's
    dream come true.  All told, I got 26 days on the mountain (I did
    need a few rest days in there).
  </p>
  <div><img src="WhistlerBlackcomb-2.jpg" width="100%" title="Me and Mark at over 6,000 feet" /></div>
  <p>
    An extra bonus to the whole adventure was that my best friend Mark
    Irwin joined me for the final weekend.  Mark had started skiing
    back home in Ohio a few years prior, but hadn't had the chance to
    ski any big mountains.  Now was the time.  We enjoyed the long
    weekend hitting the slopes together and taking in the majesty of
    the Canadian mountains.
  </p>

  <h2>Alaska</h2>
  <p>
    Speaking of month-long trips to the northern reaches &mdash; I
    spent the whole month of July in Anchorage, Alaska.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I wrote in last-year's review, my role at Databricks is a
    fully-remote position, which means I can travel and work from
    wherever I want as long as I get my job done.  I had been thinking
    about a trip to Alaska for quite some time and decided to leverage
    my remote-work situation and rented an Airbnb in Anchorage for the
    entire month of July.  I worked for the first two weeks, while
    exploring Anchorage; then took the latter half of the month as PTO
    and did all my excursions.
  </p>
  <div><img src="AnchorageDusk.jpg" width="100%" title="Anchorage at dusk, around 11pm" /></div>
  <p>
    Getting close to 20 hours of daylight was wild.  TBH, it didn't
    take long to adjust, and fortunately the Airbnb had good blackout
    curtains in the bedroom, so sleep wasn't a problem.  It was just
    trippy to be outside at 10 or 11pm and the sun wasn't even setting
    yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    My Airbnb host is part of an informal hiking group and they do a
    hike in the Anchorage area every week.  I was able to join them
    for a couple hikes, and although just about every one of them had
    a story to tell of a bear encounter, fortunately I never saw a
    bear the whole trip.  I did have a too-close-for-comfort encounter
    with an adult male moose, and that was enough wildlife for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three standout experiences to share: Denali, Seward Whale Watching Tour,
    and Matanuska Glacier Hike.
  </p>
  <div><img src="DenaliTrainViews.jpg" width="100%" title="Scenery on train ride up to Denali" /></div>
  <p>
    There's a booze-cruise tourist train that runs from Anchorage up
    to Denali National Park and Preserve.  It brought me up there for
    a short, 2-day stay at one of the resort lodges near the park
    entrance.  Amazing scenery from the train as you climb from
    sea-level Anchorage up to the mountains around Denali.  Even
    though the skies were clear, Denali is so tall it tends to create
    it's own weather system, and unfortunately it was clouded during
    my stay.  Nevertheless, I did get a long day-hike guided by a
    local tour operator, who showered us with endless knowledge of the
    flora and fauna of the region.
  </p>
  <div><img src="SewardWhaleWatching-me.jpg" width="100%" title="Seward Whale Watching Tour" /></div>
  <p>
    I did a day trip to Seward for a whale watching tour.  The train
    (again) from Anchorage to Seward (and back) winds its way through
    some absolutely stunning scenery, making the train ride an equally
    important part of the journey to the boat tour.  Once on the boat,
    we slowly made our way out to mouth of open ocean of the Gulf of
    Alaksa, where we were treated to the antics of a humpback whale
    for nearly 30 minutes.  Identified by tail markings, this one was
    recognized as "Morgan le Fay". She entertained us with lots of
    tail slaps, breaches, and spouting water.  Such a rare treat!
  </p>
  <div><img src="MatanuskaGlacierHike.jpg" width="100%" title="Matanuska Glacier hike" /></div>
  <p>
    But I must say that the most unique experience in Alaska was the
    Matanuska Glacier Hike.  Walking on the glacier felt like being on
    another planet.  It wasn't that much colder, but the desolation
    and scale of it was mind-boggling.  The glacier is 4 miles wide,
    26 miles long, and over 1,000 feet deep.  There's nothing to use
    as a sense of scale neither.  You'd see a big chunk of ice and
    think it was maybe 100-200 yards away, then the guide would tell
    you that it was actually a 4 mile hike to it.  A
    once-in-a-lifetime experience.
  </p>
  
  
  <h1>Gotta Pay the Bills</h1>
  <p>
    In more mundane matters, I remain gainfully employed by Databricks
    as a Lead Solutions Architect.  I celebrated my 4-year anniversary
    on November 11, 2023.  The company continues to do well, and I
    don't forsee any big changes there in the coming year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, returned to University of San Francisco to teach a night
    class in their MBA program.  It's only 1 class for 1 semester, so
    not a huge time commitment, but is fun to do and a rewarding
    experience.  I plan to teach it again in the coming Spring.
  </p>
  
  <h1>What's to Come?</h1>
  <p>
    What is on tap for 2024, you ask?  In January, I'm going to
    Colorado for a 17-day ski trip.  Yep, I said "ski" trip.  After
    snowboarding for the past 20 years, my snowboard equipment is
    end-of-life, so I decided to switch back to skiing this year.  I
    have a condo in Vail for 17 days and plan to hit a couple
    different resorts while I'm there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have a race schedule put together for the first half of the
    year, with a mix of races at different distances and varieties
    (some road, some trail), all culminating with the San Francisco
    Marathon at the end of July.
  </p>
