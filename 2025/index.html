  <h1>Retirement!</h1>
  <p>
    The big news for 2025 is: <b>I'm retired!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    That's right, retirement.  As in: not working...hopefully for the
    long run; at least no more corporate 9-5 job.  My decision to take
    the plunge into retirement was driven by two things: first, a
    financial opportunity to liquidate most of my Databricks stock;
    then realizing that I'm in the best physical fitness of my adult
    life and and I'm not getting any younger.  So, after building out
    about a thousand spreadsheets modeling out a million potential
    financial scenarios, I decided to go for it!
  </p>
  <div><img src="i-have-to-take-this-call.jpg" width="100%" title="I have sunshine on the other line, I have to take this call" /></div>
  <p>
    It is a big change, and I'm still getting used to it.  I decided
    to take a page out of my own playbook, in that for most of my
    career I've done 5-year chapters (roughly).  So, I figured I'd do
    the same thing for retirement and commit to 5-years of "doing all
    the things" here in the SF Bay Area and California, then after
    those 5 years: re-assess.
  </p>
  <div><img src="retirement-is-awesome.jpg" width="100%" title="Retirement is awesome!" /></div>
  <p>
    Looking back on this year, I packed in so many wonderful
    experiences: exploring foreign lands, visiting friends and family
    all over the country, eating delicous food, engaging with art and
    culture at museums and festivals, and sunning myself in the
    bleachers at a weekday day game (just to name a few).
  </p>

  <h1>Travels</h1>
  <p>
    When you retire, the first question people tend to ask is: OMG,
    where are you gonna travel to?
  </p>
  <p>
    And looking back, I did quite a bit: some overseas, some
    cross-country domestic, and some just down the coast and back.
  </p>
  <h1>Japan Ski Trip</h1>
  <p>
    I kicked-off the year with a 2-week ski trip to Japan.  Japan is
    legendary for its ski resorts getting massive amounts of powder;
    Westerners nick-naming it "Ja-pow".  And, I have to say: it lives
    up to the hype!
  </p>
  <h2>Hakuba</h2>
  <p>
    My first week was in Hakuba, which is near Nagano and where much
    of the 1998 Winter Olympics were held.  There are a total of 8 ski
    resorts stretching across the ridgeline of mountains overlooking
    the Hakuba valley; 4 bigger resorts and 4 smaller ones.
  </p>
  <div><img src="hakuba.jpg" width="100%" title="View of Hakuba valley from Hakuba Goryu Snow Resort" /></div>
  <p>
    I arrived just after a significant snowstorm and the entire valley
    was buried in feet of snow, with more falling throughout my week
    skiing there.  It was magical with fresh pow every morning.  I
    stayed at a family-run BnB type place that was a short walk from
    one of the resorts.  And Japan, being a well-organized, sensible
    country, had shuttles running to all the resorts, so it was easy
    to hit all the bigger resorts during my week there.  I'd say there
    was maybe 25-33% foreigners at the Hakuba resorts, it felt more
    like the place where Japanese families go for skiing and not as
    big a draw for foreigners. I enjoyed the more "native Japan" vibes
    of Hakuba, compared to Niseko.
  </p>
  <h2>Niseko</h2>
  <p>
    Week 2 was in Niseko, on the island of Hokkaido, a few hours drive
    from Sapporo.  Niseko is comprised of 4 large resorts all on the
    same mountain.  There are shuttles that connect the bases, but you
    can ski from one to the next at the very top of the mountain.  My
    last day there, I made a point to do the "peak-to-base" run on all
    4 resorts.  Niseko is also famous for its views of Mount Yōtei,
    which is called "Little Fuji" due to its similar shape to Mount
    Fuji, just smaller.
  </p>
  <div><img src="niseko.jpg" width="100%" title="View of Mount Yōtei (a.k.a. &quot;Little Fuji&quot;) from Niseko ski slopes" /></div>
  <p>
    And, if Hakuba is where Japanese locals go, then Niseko is where
    all the foreign tourists go to ski.  My guess is that 75% of the
    skiers at Niseko were foreigners, with lots of Aussies and Kiwis,
    and plenty of Chinese.  It was a very different vibe than Hakuba.
    Hakuba was more a local-chill vibe, whereas Niseko had the busy
    bars, restaurants, and nightlife.  Both enjoyable, depending on
    what you're in to.  I'm glad I did Hakuba first, to get the
    "Japanese locals experience" then shifting into the higher-energy
    international experience of Niseko for the second half of the
    trip.
  </p>
  <h2>Food!</h2>
  <p>
    And of course: the food!  I was extra lucky in that the USD-JPY
    exchange rate was at an all time high, so that everything in Japan
    was extra cheap for American tourists.  I took advantage of this
    by eating all the wagyu steak dinners I could get my hands on.  I
    mean, you could get the full wagyu steak dinner, with apps and
    drinks, for about 1/3 the price in the US.  I think I had 6 over
    the course of the two week trip.
  </p>
  <div><img src="wagyu.jpg" width="100%" title="One of my many wagyu steak dinners" /></div>
  <p>
    Also, the ski lodge food was both good and inexpensive.  I got a
    huge bowl of snow crab ramen lunch for same cost as a side-order
    of fries at a Tahoe resort.
  </p>

  <h1>Cowboy Country</h1>
  <p>
    In early May, I had an ultra-marathon in Austin, my
    second <a href="https://brylers.com">Brylers Backyard Marathon<a>,
    so I decided to make a trip out of it, visiting "cowboy country"
    starting in Oklahoma City, stopping in Fort Worth and Dallas, and
    finishing up in Austin for the race.  Other than Austin, I hadn't
    been to those cities before, so I was excited to do some domestic
    exploring.  Also, and perhaps surprisingly, I was able to transit
    among the cities by train! There's an Amtrak line that runs from
    OKC to Dallas, an inter-city rail connects Dallas an Fort Worth,
    and then another Amtrak line from Fort Worth to Austin.  Traveling
    through cowboy country by train -- who would have thought?
  </p>
  <h2>Oklahoma City</h2>
  <p>
    I have to say: OKC punches above it's weight.  I really didn't
    know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.  They've
    clearly but a lot of time, effort and money into revitalizing
    their downtown area, building out significant park and open space
    between downtown and the Oklahoma River, with the Myriad
    Botantical Gardens being an absolute gem.
  </p>
  <div><img src="okc-myriad.jpg" width="100%" title="Oklahoma City Myriad Botanical Gardens" /></div>
  <p>
    Oklahoma City is also home to the last remaining cattle stockyard
    auction house in the US.  Each week, thousands and thousands of
    cattle are brought here from all over the country for auction.
    Each steer is paraded through the auction house, one by one, where
    buyers can see them either in person or remotely via video feed
    and make their bids.  Unfortunately, I arrived the day after the
    weekly auction, but I did get a tour from the operators.
  </p>

  <div><img src="okc-auction-house.jpg" width="100%" title="Oklahoma National Stockyards Auction House" /></div>
  <div><img src="" width="100%" title="" /></div>
  <h2>Fort Worth</h2>
  <p>
    I have to say, much like OKC, I was pleasantly surprised by Fort
    Worth.  It has some legit open spaces along the Clear Fork Tinity
    River, and a very good collection of museums and cultural
    instiutions.  In fact, if you combine the Fort Worth and Dallas
    museums together, they would stack up against any other
    metropolitain area.  I was impressed.
  </p>
  <div><img src="ft-worth-cowgirl-museum.jpg" width="100%" title="National Cowgirl Museum &amp; Hall of Fame" /></div>
  <p>
    Another pleasant surprise in Fort Worth was the Will Rogers
    Memorial Center.  As I was passing by to do my morning run through
    Trinity Park, I noticed the parking lot was full of horse
    trailers, and a woman was unloading a horse from one.  I asked her
    what we going on and she said there was a roping competition going
    on that day, and that it was free to the public.  So, after my
    run, I showered up, and headed back to Will Roders and watched
    teams of cowboys rope calfs on horseback.
  </p>
  <div><img src="ft-worth-cattle-roping.jpg" width="100%" title="Cowboys doing cowboy things in Fort Worth" /></div>
  
  <h2>Dallas</h2>
  <p>
    TBH, compared to Fort Worth, Dallas was kinda meh.  At least the
    downtown area.  It felt like any other city downtown in America,
    with a Starbucks on every corner and an unbelievable amount of
    parking garages.  It seemed that every other building in downtown
    Dallas was a parking garage, and the bottom half of every condo
    tower was for parking.  Maybe if I ventured farther out from the
    city core, I would have found some more interesting neighborhoods.
    All that said, there were some highlights: Katy trail, Dallas
    Museum of Art, Perot Museum of Nature and Science, and the
    historic M-Line Trolley.
  </p>
  <div><img src="dallas-m-line-trolley.png" width="100%" title="Historic M-Line Trolley" /></div>
  <p>
    The Katy trail is one of the many "rail-to-trail" success stories
    where an old rail line is converted to a walking/biking path.  It
    was perfect for me and my morning run on my first of two days in
    Dallas.  About halfway down the trail, I passed by the Katy Trail
    Icehouse, a beer garden that I returned to after the run to down a
    cold one and grab a bite to eat.
  </p>
  <div><img src="dallas-katy-trail-icehouse.jpg" width="100%" title="Katy Trail Icehouse beer garden" /></div>
  <p>
    The second of my two days in Dallas was spent at the Dallas Museum
    of Art.  It's a huge art museum with plenty of exhibits to fill up
    a whole day, which was perfect as a major thunderstorm sat on
    Dallas all day.  Rainy museum days are some of my favorite.
  </p>
  <div><img src="dallas-museum-of-art.jpg" width="100%" title="Dallas Museum of Art" /></div>

  <h2>Austin</h2>
  <p>
    I rolled into Austin to meet up with
    my <a href="https://brylers.com">Brylers</a> running crew for my
    second Brylers Backyard Marathon, a 2.4-mile loop that we run at
    the top of the hour, every hour, until we give up.  We bested last
    year's lap count by one, going 16 laps this time around (~38.4
    miles total).
  </p>

    <img src="austin-brylers-lapcount.jpg" width="49%" title="Brylers lap count" />
  </div>
  <p>
    And the next day, after the race, I made the obligatory
    pilgrimages to Barton Springs for a cool dip to soothe the sore
    muscles, and then Terry Black's to refuel the engine.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    I also got a chance to visit with Harsha, Carrie, and their two
    girls while I was there.  It was so great to see them all again,
    as it had been many years.

  <h1>Time on Feet!</h1>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, I did the Brylers Backyard Marathon again this
    year, along with a whole bunch more races.  In fact, looking back,
    I kinda went overboard with the race calendar in 2025 and will
    probably dial it back a bit for 2026.  All told, I did:
    <ul>
      <li>2 5k races</li>
      <li>3 10k races</li>
      <li>Bay 2 Breakers</li>
      <li>3 Half-marathons</li>
      <li>2 Full road marathons</li>
      <li>5 Ultra marathons</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    And while each race is fun in its own way, the best ones
    are where I get to run with friends.

  <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
  <p>
    I'm excited for all sorts of new adventures and experiences in
    2026.  The only thing that can make it better is for you to be a
    part of it.  I hope to see you in the new year!
