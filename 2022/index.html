    Hey there beautiful people!
  </p>
  <p>
    Buckle-up...it's gonna be a long read :)
  </p>
  <p>
    I've never been one to send out an annual holiday card with a
    photo and list of highlights of the year.  But, 2022 has been a
    transformational year for me, so I thought I'd catch you all up
    with what's been going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's actually start back in 2020, when COVID landed and we all
    went into lockdown.  Quarantining was the right choice, and I
    strictly observed all quarantine protocols for 2020 and 2021.  I
    was first in line to get my initial COVID vaccine and have been
    rigorous in keeping up with my booster schedule.  While I'm sure I
    have been exposed to COVID along the way, I have been fortunate to
    have not had a noticeable bout of it (whew!)
  </p>
  <p>
    In November, 2021, I hit the big 50!  I was fortunate enough to
    have a bunch of good friends travel far and wide to celebrate it
    with me here in San Francisco, culminating with a ginormous feast
    at Harris's Steak House surrounded by so many dear friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, let's skip ahead a bit.  By Spring of this year, I was
    feeling, well...not great.  More specifically, during quarantine,
    I really got into a sedentary lifestyle: just sitting around all
    day, and eating and drinking out of boredom being stuck at home.
    By Spring of this year, I had really packed on the pounds, and was
    up to nearly 250 pounds.  All that tailored clothing I had
    accumulated over the years...none of that came even close to
    fitting any more.  I was pretty unhappy with the state of affairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I made some significant changes starting in the summer!
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately for me, my employer decided that my whole team is
    "remote", which means that we can go total "digital nomad" if we
    want.  So that's what I did.  Starting in August, I just hit the
    road and didn't come back home unil October 31st!
  </p>
  <p>
    The first half of August was spent in California, availing myself
    of Amtrak's Coast Starlight train visit Santa Barbara, Ventura,
    and Paso Robles.  I stayed with Eric & Wendy (and fam) in Santa
    Barbara, with Airbnb's for the other stops.  After a brief stop at
    home, it was off again, this time for 10 weeks!  I took the Amtrak
    California Zepher train from Emeryville to Denver.  It was a 2 day
    trip, and I booked a private room with a little fold-out bed for
    the one night.  The first day was in beautiful California scenery,
    climbing from the Bay Area up through Tahoe and into Nevada; then
    overnight through Nevada and western Utah and wake up outside Salt
    Lake City.  Day 2 is meandering along the Colorado River, cutting
    through the Rocky Mountains, descending into Denver in the evening
    of the second day.  Spectacular!
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    While in the Denver area, I got to visit with Scott & Amy and fam
    for a week where I truly experienced how hot it gets there in the
    late summer.  I was not prepared for 90+F days in late August!  On
    a Sunday, we packed up their kids and did a day trip up to Rocky
    Mountain National Park, which totally lives up to the hype!  I
    even got a little light-headed up at the 11,500 foot visitors
    center at the peak.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="RockyMountainNationalPark.jpg" width="100%" title="Rocky Mountain National Park" />
  </div>
  <p>
    From Denver, I flew direct to Montreal, Canada.  Montreal was on
    my "to visit" list for a long time, and I figured that September
    would be the perfect month to visit &mdash; catch the tail end of the
    summer, but before real Autumn weather arrived.  I rented an
    apartment on Airbnb and spent the entire month of September there.
    I loved it!  It was fun to explore on foot, and discover which
    parts of French culture permeated Montreal life, and which did
    not.  When I first arrived, it felt very French: with everyone
    around me speaking French, and cafes and boulangeries easy to
    find.  But when I sat down for my first dinner at a local
    restaurant, holy smokes, North American portion sizes!  The first
    bowl of poutine I ordered, which was their smallest size, could
    have easily fed a family of four.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those portion sizes aside, this is when I really started my
    fitness journey.  Since I was still ostensibly working West Coast
    hours, I could wake up early in Montreal and spend the morning
    exploring on foot, then return around lunch time, work through the
    afternoon, and then a little more in the evening as needed.  The
    flexible working hours afforded me the time to "get my steps in",
    typically at least 3-4 miles each day.  But it didn't feel like a
    chore, as I had this whole new city to explore and discover.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="BelvedereKondiaronk.jpg" width="100%" title="Belvedere Kondiaronk in Montreal" />
  </div>
  <p>
    My apartment was at the far end of the Gay Village &mdash; yep, you
    read that right, the LGBTQ+ neighborhood in Montreal.  I
    appreciate their directness in naming :) It felt very San
    Francisco in many ways.  It was also great for walking, as most
    neighborhoods had their main street closed off to car traffic, so
    you could really take your time wandering around w/o having to
    dodge lots of cars.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hit most of the cultural highlights while there: Old town
    Montreal, wOlympic Stadium and Park, BioDome and Insectarium,
    Botanical Gardens, Montreal Museum of History, Museum of Fine
    Arts, the hike up to the top of the Kondiaronk Belvedere, and the
    utterly fantastic BioSphere &mdash; an enormous Bucky Dome.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="BioSphere.jpg" width="100%" title="Montreal Biosphere" />
  </div>
  <p>
    Also, while in Montreal, I took a weekend trip up to Quebec City.
    Just a 3.5 hour train ride each way.  The "old city" part of
    Quebec City definitely feels like a chunk of 18th Century Paris
    was cut out and dropped onto North America, with parts of the old
    city wall dating back to the 1600s.  It was a perfect tourist
    weekend, with old, winding streets to discover; views of the
    St. Lawrence River; and lots of delicious food and drink.
    Speaking of food, I had an excellent meal at L'Orygine, where all
    their food is grown within 100 km of Quebec City.  I love tasting
    the regional variations.  The wines were mostly from the Finger
    Lakes Region of New York.  Although there is a wine industry in
    Quebec Province, I tried some and they were not very good.  So, I
    was glad that L'Orygine was sourcing wines from a better region.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of September, it was time to depart Montreal...but
    where to go to next?  I was thinking of visiting Maine, or
    somewhere in the Northeast, since it would be October and
    hopefully I could catch some fall foliage and indulge in
    fresh-caught lobster.  It turned out that staying in Canada was
    easiest and I wound up headed for the Maritimes &mdash; Halifax, Nova
    Scotia.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stayed in Halifax for about 10 days, and to be honest, 4-5 would
    have been enough.  It's just not that big of a city.  There were
    for sure some cool things to see, especially along the waterfront,
    but not enough to fill a 10 day itinerary.  A highlight was
    booking a day tour out to Peggy's Cove, one of the many fishing
    coves dotting the Nova Scotian coastline.  I wouldn't even call it
    a fishing village, as there are only about 30 permanent housing
    structures in the cove.  Only maybe a dozen families live there
    year-round.  Peggy's Cove is known for its lighthouse, perched
    atop granite rock formations that were carved out by glaciers
    thousands and thousands of years ago.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="PeggysCove.jpg" width="100%" title="Peggy's Cove" />
  </div>
  <p>
    The other highlight of Halifax was the seafood!  I made it my
    mission to eat a full-on lobster dinner each and every single
    night I was there &mdash; mission accomplished!  But, as decadent as
    the whole steamed lobster was, the oysters is what really stole
    the show.  So fresh, right from the ocean around Nova Scotia, and
    shucked exactly how I like them: with just a little squeeze of
    lemon.  It's like eating the sea.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="LobsterDinner.jpg" width="100%" title="Full-on lobster dinner" />
  </div>
  <p>
    Oh, and I almost ran into Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
    &mdash; quite literally!  I took the ferry across Halifax Harbor, to
    the small town of Dartmouth.  As I was strolling along the main
    drag, I noticed a group huddled around the entrance to a
    restaurant.  I figured that maybe this would be a place to stop
    for lunch.  As I approached, I realized that the small crowd were
    all men dressed in dark suits, and they all had those "secret
    service earpieces".  Just as I was thinking, "what's going on
    here", Justin Trudeau comes bounding out of the restaurant,
    walking right in front of me, passing me by to his car and travel
    entourage parked around the corner.  Then off he went.  I couldn't
    believe I could casually get within a few feet of the Canadian
    Prime Minister.  Had this been the US, I would have been tackled
    to the ground 100 yards away from the President.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, my time in Halifax was concluded, but it was not time to
    leave Canada just yet.  I spent the next week in Toronto.  I
    decided to see what it would be like living in one of those
    high-rise condo buildings in the heart of downtown, so I booked
    one via Airbnb for the week.  The location was fantastic!  Right
    next to the CN Tower and all that downtown Toronto has to offer.
    Oh, and when I checked-in, I discovered that I was on the 55th
    floor of a 65 storey building!  The views were simply outstanding.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="TorontoCondoView.jpg" width="100%" title="Night-time view of CN Tower from condo unit" />
  </div>
  <p>
    That said, the high-rise condo building lifestyle was not entirely
    to my tastes.  Well, mostly due to the elevator and lobby design.
    There over 500 units in the building, which means a lot of people
    going in-and-out, but the elevator lobby was super tiny and always
    crowded with people.  It was enough of a hassle to dissuade you
    for running out for a quick errand.  I suspect that people get a
    lot of food delivery in that building.  The unit itself was small,
    like 500 sq ft, but nice and clean and again...the views.  It was
    fun to stay for a week, but certainly not somewhere I'd like to
    live.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the Toronto highlights was taking the ferry over to Ward's
    Island, part of the Toronto Islands, just a short ferry ride from
    downtown Toronto.  Ward's Island is best known as being entirely
    pedestrian (outside of service/emergency vehicles).  No private
    car ownership is allowed on the island, and the small community of
    people that live there just use their bikes and the ferry to get
    around.  Compared the hustle-and-bustle of downtown Toronto,
    strolling along the island's waterfronts was such a peacful way to
    spend an afternoon.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="TorontoIslands.jpg" width="100%" title="Toronto Islands" />
  </div>
  <p>
    Also, by now it was nearly mid-October, and the fall colors were
    really starting to show.  The islands where alight in bright reds,
    oranges and yellows, and the parks along the Toronto waterfront
    were similarly colorful.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, it was also time to return to the US and start the final legs
    of my travels.  Also, it was time to check-off another bucket-list
    item: Niagara Falls!
  </p>
  <p>
    Canada Rail departs from downtown Toronto and arrives into the
    Canadian side of Niagara Falls a few hours later.  While the train
    does cross into the US via Amtrak, I decided to cross the
    US-Canadian border by foot.  I think I have crossed an
    international border by every other method at least once in my
    life: plane, car, boat, train, etc.  But I had never done it on
    foot before.  So, after disembarking the train on the Canadian
    side, I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked across the
    Rainbow Bridge to the US.
  </p>
  <div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="CrossingOnFoot.jpg" width="100%" title="Crossing the Rainbow Bridge on foot"/>
  </div>
  <p>
    I only stayed the weekend in Niagara Falls, NY, but got in a full
    day at the falls &mdash; lives up to the hype!  Also, like Toronto, the
    fall colors were in full display, with the wooded parks right
    along the falls fully ablaze in Autumn splendor.  One thing that
    amazed me about the falls was how close you could get.  You could
    stand right next to the Bridal Falls, with just a short railing
    between you and millions of gallons of water rushing over the
    edge.  It was a very visceral experience to stand so close.  And
    the Horseshoe Falls created such a plume of mist, that as I
    approached, it almost looked like the rising smoke from a fire.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="NiagaraFalls.jpg" width="100%" title="Niagara Falls" />
  </div>
  <p>
    One surprising highlight of Niagara Falls was the Underground
    Railroad Museum.  Since Canada had outlawed slavery long before
    the US, and even just New York state, Niagara Falls was a popular
    place for enslaved peoples to escape to freedom.  I learned that
    the owners and staff of popular hotel on the New York side of the
    river would help secret enslaved workers across the river in the
    dead of night.  Enslaver families from the south would vacation in
    upstate New York, and visit the falls, bringing their enslaved
    workers along with them.  Hotel workers would help people escape
    to Canada, and the hotel owners would plead ignorance
    (sorry-not-sorry).
  </p>
  <p>
    And now onto the final leg of my journey: Cleveland!  My love
    affair with the train continues, traveling from Buffalo, NY to
    Cleveland on the "red-eye" Lake Shore Limited line.  I spent the
    last two weeks of October staying with the families of my dear
    college friends and fraternity brothers Steve Conway and Mark
    Irwin.  While we all still had to tend to our work
    responsibilities, it was great just to spend time with them all:
    cooking weeknight dinners with the family, attending their kids
    sporting events, and since it is Cleveland...watching some
    football games.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also was able to get my steps in!  And by this point, I was up
    to over 6 miles per day and had dropped over 10 pounds since I
    started the trip.  Mark Irwin and I went for a couple hikes in the
    Cleveland Metroparks system: Rocky River Reservation, and Hinckley
    Reservation.  While a student at Case, I never really appreciated
    the natural beauty of the area around Cleveland; but this time
    around, I really enjoyed the hikes and taking in the lovely Autumn
    scenery.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="MeAndMark.jpg" width="100%" title="Me and Mark hiking Rocky River Reservation" />
  </div>
  <p>
    At the end of October, I returned home to San Francsico.  Nearly 3
    full months on the road, living life as a "digital nomad".
    All-in-all, my summer/fall travels were
    <ul>
      <li>August</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Santa Barbara</li>
        <li>Ventura</li>
        <li>Paso Robles</li>
        <li>Denver</li>
      </ul>
      <li>September</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Montreal</li>
        <li>Quebec City</li>
      </ul>
      <li>October</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Halifax</li>
        <li>Toronto</li>
        <li>Niagara Falls</li>
        <li>Cleveland</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since returning home, I've kept up the fitness routine &mdash;
    increasing it even.  In October, I walked a total of 201.8 miles,
    an average of 6.5 miles per day.  I ramped that up to 8.8
    miles/day in November, totalling 262.8 miles for the month.  And
    so far in December, I'm again averaging 8.9 miles/day.  Oh, and I
    also decided to go beyond just walking, picked up a pair of proper
    running shoes and ran my first 5K since...well high school (so,
    like 33 years).
  </p>
  <div>
    <img src="ElfRun.jpg" width="100%" title="My first 5K in 33 years!" />
  </div>
  <p>
    And it's paid off!  Earlier this year, I was pushing 250 lbs and
    as I am writing this on Christmas Day, I weighed myself this
    morning and am down to 210.  I just feel much, much better in
    every way.  Carrying less weight around it great, but I've also
    increased my strength and endurance quite a bit.  San Francisco
    hills that I used to dread having to trudge up, I can just blast
    up without breaking a sweat.  I'm feeling really good going into
    the winter months.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, and speaking of winter activities, my next trip is up to
    Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort for the entire month of January!  I
    booked a ski-in/ski-out condo on Airbnb and plan to get on the
    slopes each and every day.  I'm flying up Thursday (Dec 29) and
    spending New Years and the whole month of January there.  Another
    bucket-list item checked off in a big way :)
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also been very fortunate in continuing to dodge COVID.  I got
    my latest booster (and flu shot) upon returning in early November,
    and have so far tested negative every time.  With the holidays in
    full swing, I hope everyone comes through unscathed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wishing you all peace, love, happiness and good health in 2023!
